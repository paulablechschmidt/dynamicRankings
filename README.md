# dynamic proportional rankings with AVA
This is a short simulation used for my bachelor's thesis, in which dynamic D'Hondt and lazy D'Hondt are simulated and then checked for patterns in the ordering of candidates. 

The code uses preference files in the .soi and .soc format from the folder /preflib taken from the prefblib library. See www.preflib.org for more information.

Use the program either simply by calling it or by piping in input in the .soc or .soi format. Then follow instructions on screen.

The I/O still needs work and currently simulating both rules in a single run does not work.
